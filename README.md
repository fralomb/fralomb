👋 Hey there! I'm a Cloud Engineer and DevOps and a knack for Kubernetes, harnessing the power of Neovim for seamless coding experiences. My focus is on creating resilient cloud architectures and optimizing workflows for maximum efficiency and scalability. I thrive on challenges in cloud architecture and enjoy sharing my experiences with Kubernetes, CI/CD, and system reliability.

🏃 Outside of tech, running is my escape, helping me maintain a creative and sharp problem-solving mindset.

🤝 Keen to collaborate on open-source projects, I'm always exploring new horizons in cloud technology and coding. Open for collaboration and eager to learn, let's connect and innovate together in the realms of Cloud and DevOps!
