👋 Greetings! I'm an experienced Cloud and DevOps Engineer specialist with a mastery for Kubernetes and a passion for the terminal and expecially for efficient text editing using Neovim. My expertise lies in architecting robust cloud solutions and streamlining workflows to achieve peak performance and scalability. I relish tackling complex challenges in cloud architecture and find great satisfaction in sharing insights on Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and enhancing system reliability.

🏃 When not immersed in code, I lace up my running shoes and find relif and inspiration while hitting the road. This physical pursuit not only keeps me energized but also sharpens my problem-solving skills, fostering a creative approach to technical challenges.

🤝 Keen to collaborate on open-source projects, I'm constantly exploring cutting edge technologies, open to new collaborations and eager to expand my knowledge.
